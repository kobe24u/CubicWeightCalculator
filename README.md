## Setup Instructions:
### CocoaPods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

1, Open Terminal.
2, If you haven't install CocoaPods before, run this command:

``` $ gem install cocoapods ```

Wait for it to finish before proceeding.
3, Find the project directory in the Finder. This should be the folder that has the Xcode project in it.
4, Type cd into the terminal, followed by a space.
5, Drag and drop the project directory into the terminal window. It should now say something like this:

``` cd /Users/someone/Downloads/KoganCodingTest.xcworkspace ```

6, Press return.
Now type pod install. Wait for that to finish. It could take a while.
Done!

7, Now type 

``` open KoganCodingTest.xcworkspace ```

this should help open the project using Xcode

8, Wait for the project to finish loading for the first time, click the play button in the top bar, then the app will start running
